They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... \n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  \"What happened?\" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \"Isn't it obvious?\" he said. \"Sam sung Note 7.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!

Donald, duck!\u201d", "Two boys in Egypt free a crocodile... In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.\n\nOne day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher\u2019s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.\n\nOnce freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! \u201cThank you, young men\u201d said the fairy, \u201cYour hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my friend Set, and you can call me \u2018Ep\u2019\u201d, said Amenhotep.\n\n\u201cVery well, Ep\u201d said the fairy \u201cWhat is the desire of your heart?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I was the strongest man in the world!\u201d Amenhotep wished. \n\n\u201cVery well\u201d, said the fairy, \u201cbut you must always use your strength to help others.\u201d Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. \n\nThe fairy turned to Set \u201cAnd what is your wish, Set?\u201d\nSet responded \u201cI never want to be poor again! I wish for money!\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. \u201cGreetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!\u201d\n\n\u201cElmon is an expert in all things money,\u201d said the fairy, \u201cHe will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.\u201d\n\nAmenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname \u201cImp\u201d. With Elmon\u2019s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  \n\nYears passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. \n\nEp and Set\u2019s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. \n\nAs all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.\n\nJosep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.\n\nUpon reading the proposal and its ill-nature\u2019s effect on Set\u2019s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.\n\nJosep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.\n\nAmenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.\n\nWithout the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set\u2019s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. \u201cCome, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let\u2019s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.\u201d\n\nSet refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon\u2019s murder.\n\nThe case was brought before the court, but Set\u2019s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.\n\nObviously, Ep\u2019s teen didn\u2019t kill Imp\u2019s elf.", "My girlfriend asked me to name off all my sexual partners in order I probably should've stopped when I got to her name", "President Donald Trump and his driver were cruising along a country road President Donald Trump and his driver were cruising along a country road one night when all of a sudden they hit a pig, killing it instantly.\n\nTrump told his driver to go up to the farmhouse and explain to the owners what had happened.

No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie.

There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  \n  \nAbout 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  \n  \nThe dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  \n  \nThe grim reaper swears. \"Oh no! This always happens with identical twins\".  \n  \n\"What do you mean?\" asks the dentist.  \n  \n\"Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.\"  \n  \nThe dentist is noticeably upset. He says \"Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.\"  \n  \nThe grim reaper asks \"What do you have in mind?\"  \n  \nThe dentist thinks. \"How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.\"  \n  \nThe grim reaper laughs. \"I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?\"  \n  \nThe dentist smiles. \"I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.\"  \n  \n\"Very well\" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  \n  \nOnce there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. \"You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.\"  \n  \nThe dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  \n  \nIt's unbelievable.  \n  \nThe shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  \n  \nThe winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. \"You win, human. This time. Your brother will live.\" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. \"Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.\"  \n  \nThe dentist smiles on the phone and says. \"That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.\"", "Yesterday, I changed a light bulb, crossed the street, and walked into a bar.

The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.\n\nUpon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins.

The basket fell off the seat and all the eggs broke.\u201d The moral of the story is not to put all your eggs in one basket. \u201cVery good,\u201d said the teacher. Next, Mary said, \u201cWe are farmers too. We had twenty eggs waiting to hatch, but when they did we only got ten chicks.\u201d The moral of this story is not to count your chickens before they\u2019re hatched . \u201cVery good,\u201d said the teacher again, very pleased with the response so far.\n\nNext it was Barney\u2019s turn to tell his story: \u201cMy dad told me this story about my Aunt Karen. Aunt Karen was a flight engineer in the war and her plane got hit. She had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete.\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d said the teacher, intrigued.\n\n\u201cAunt Karen drank the whiskey on the way down to prepare herself. Then she landed right in the middle of a hundred enemy soldiers. She killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she ran out of bullets. Then she killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke. And then she killed the last ten with her bare hands.\u201d \u201cGood heavens,\u201d said the horrified teacher, \u201cWhat did your father say was the moral of that frightening Story?\u201d\n\nThe child said: \u201cStay away from Aunt Karen when she\u2019s been drinking.\u201d", "My girlfriend yelled at me today saying, \"You weren't even listening just now, were you?!\" I thought, \"Man, what a weird way to start a conversation.\"", "A Marine returns from duty in Iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in Afghanistan.

He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n\"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n\nSo the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"\n", "Why haven't Aliens visited our Solar System yet? ...

A customer was the one who ultimately complained to the manager and I was gracefully fired the following day when I walked in to start my shift. I had come from working at a bar previously, so the fact that more sensitive people/families were the ones showing up completely slipped my mind as I was in the back cracking joke with the other chef (a  10+ year veteran of the industry.)The owner was pretty cool with everything all things considered, but explained that they just couldn\u2019t take the risk of something else happening. I even got to say goodbye to everyone before I left, including the head chef who originally hired me, and everyone was really supportive and understanding. \n\n3.

The only exception to their frugality was their dog Max whom they doted on at every possible occasion. \n\nUnfortunately for Max, fate had terrible plans in store for him. One dark August day, Mallory and Mark were both at their respective jobs and in a cruel twist of fate suffered major mechanical failures at the same time. In a million to one oddity, they both perished in the astonishing first-of-its-kind airplane/submarine accident.\n\nThe funeral was a simple affair, but it was the reading of the will that shocked the attendees; everything they owned had been left to Max. The Kensington family was understandably upset about this, and within a few months time, the lawyers had finagled their way through to screwing Max over with little thought to his feelings. Shortly thereafter, unloved, unwanted, and alone\u2026 Max had been cast out onto the streets of New York penniless. As you can imagine, this was a real hardship for Max.\n\nMax, destitute, wandered for weeks before he finally settled down on the corner of 5th and Main. He found a \u201ccomfortable\u201d cardboard box to live in, and his friend Hobo Jones was relatively sane. Now for Max, this whole new life was a real hardship, and difficult to adjust to but\u2026 he persevered. A few months later, while talking to Hobo Jones, he learned that there was a dog show in town. While an unattended dog at a show may be slightly unusual, Max thought it just might be possible for him to improve his lot in life\u2026 there was a cash prize!\n\nAt the dog show, Max was suitably impressive. He had bathed in the local gutter with Hobo Jones\u2019 help, and positively glowed with a hint of the radiance that he once had under the care of the Kensingtons. The judges muttered among themselves every time they saw him and to a man they decided to award Max first place. \n\nEcstatic, Max approached the judges\u2019 panel. Unfortunately, dog show judges aren\u2019t the most scrupulous of people, and they kept the money, only giving Max his trophy. What dog can complain about being cheated? Faced with yet another hardship, Max lugged his trophy home, whilst the judges had a wild night on the town with the cash that was supposed to go to the winner.\n\nHobo Jones comforted Max when he got back. \u201cMax, it\u2019s OK. I know you got screwed, but hey you got this really neat trophy and at least you\u2019re qualified for the city-wide dog show! Maybe the judges will be better there, and you can really move up.\u201d\n\nMax considered this good advice, and while his hardships seemed overwhelming at times, Hobo Jones had made a fair point. For the next month, Max trained himself like never before. He exercised regularly, worked his fur into a grand sheen, and all around just persevered. The day of the city-wide show came around and he was excited. He trotted down to the performance hall, and quickly impressed everyone in attendance. By time the second round of judging had occurred, he was considered a favorite to win, and by the final round of judging, he was the clear victor. Ecstatic, he rushed to claim his prize.\n\nI don\u2019t wish to dishearten you or cast a pallor on the integrity of dog show judges everywhere but\u2026 Max was just cursed by hardships. The judges at this particular show were, if anything, more corrupt than the previous judges. Max received his trophy, and accolades rang from all but the cash was sadly lacking. These judges liked Vegas more than they liked dogs, and the prize money that no human could claim would get them there in style. Max, heartbroken, trudged home through the pouring rain dragging his (rather large) trophy behind him.\n\nTo the rescue came Hobo Jones. Max\u2019s distressed demeanor was lightened by his antics and encouragement. After all, it was true that he had qualified for the state championships. Besides, Max was practically creating a name for himself in the dog show world\u2026 two overwhelming victories with no owner? Almost preposterous! So, that night, Max curled up around his two trophies and considered that maybe his hardships were coming to an end. He wagged his tail a bit before he fell asleep.\n\nThis same sorry state of affairs continued for Max through State, Regional and even the National dog show. When Max had just won the national dog show, he should have been living the good life, the $10,000 prize would have bought him quite a bit of comfort. Unfortunately, plagued by hardships and corrupt judges, Max had nothing but his five trophies to keep him warm at night. With a frustrated shake of his head, Max decided to simply focus on how he would get to the international dog show in Paris at the end of the year. He decided to see if he could get passage on a ship.\n\nAfter spending an entire day begging every captain he met on the pier to take him along, Max was beginning to despair. Nobody seemed to want a dog underfoot, regardless of how useful he may be. Luckily though, he decided to try one last ship. It was an old thing, and looked like it had come straight out of a story book. It was a ship that had clearly seen better days, and was in fact astonishing for it\u2019s incongruity amongst other more modern ships\u2026 it even had sails! Max trotted up to the grizzled old sea captain and bade him good afternoon. Astonishingly, Max\u2019s luck seemed to take a turn right away for the captain immediately lit up and started chatting like they had been old friends his whole life. Within an hour, Max had secured passage to Paris (provided he work during transit) and had found a new friend.\n\nThe following morning, Max took his leave of Hobo Jones and boarded the ship. For many months they sailed and had many grand adventures, but this story is not about those. Suffice it to say that the captain and Max grew very fond of one another, and they shared many stories of hardships that each at faced. When they finally reached Paris, the captain promised to wait for Max, and wished him good luck at the show.\nThis was it! The international dog show that Max had been preparing for for so many months. He strutted in confidently and was greeted with uproarious applause\u2026 he was practically famous now! The dog with no owner, the champion extraordinaire. Round after round of judging, dog after dog was eliminated. Finally, it came down to just two dogs, Max and another Yorkshire named Augustus Winthrop the Third. \n\nThe judges whispered amongst themselves for an eternity.\nAs you well know, the prize for the international dog show is nothing to sneeze at. It well exceeds thousands of pounds, and could set all of Max\u2019s hardships aside for the duration of his life. Unfortunately, human greed being what it is and Max\u2019s lack of human company being what it was\u2026 he never had a chance. With yet another cruel laugh from the fates, the judges awarded Max the title of champion dog, the trophy, the accolades, and\u2026 not the money. Max faced with yet another hardship, lugged the huge trophy back to the ship, and sadly went to his bunk. Tired out, and depressed, he promptly fell asleep. The captain, knowing what had occurred the moment he saw Max arrive, decided to leave immediately and cursed the judges heartily as they sailed out of port.\n\nSeveral hours later, a freak storm blew up. Sailors were cursing, the captain was wide-eyed with stress, and Max was awoken by the noise. He scampered to deck just in time to notice a sailor caught in the rigging trying to bring down one of the sails. Without pausing a moment to think, Max bounded up the rigging and immediately helped the sailor free, chewing through the ropes that had ensnared him. He let the sailor down first and was about to follow suit when a sudden wave rocked the ship violently and the worst happened. Max lost his grip.\n\nMax fell.\n\nMax hit the deck.\n\nMax didn\u2019t move.\n\nIn one of those weird little moments of life, the sudden fury of the world paused. The sailors all gasped, shocked. The captain turned his eyes towards Max. Nobody moved. Nothing moved. They all prayed silently for the poor dog, hoping against hope that he would rise once more. The spell was broken by the first mate who took a step forward, then another, another\u2026 tears were appearing in his eyes. Then, miracle of miracles\u2026 Max got up. He was fine! The sailors all cheered, shouting for joy. \n\nThe first mate, astonished, turned to the captain and said, \u201cCaptain, how could Max survive a fall like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d said the captain, unsurprised in the least, \u201che was used to hard ships.\u201d", "What language do British chemists speak?

Basically, this group of cannibals from a common and clean suburb would don fancy robs and meet up in a secluded room in an abandoned underground subway once a week. This cult liked to be a bit different from the rest, however. \n\nEvery week, when they gathered around a round table and a single lit candle, they each take turns reporting on a meal they've eaten. Usually, it's a human limb, alongside something special - an item they've never eaten before as a side. This is their attempt at making themselves unique and spicing up their dishes.\n\nOne week, the group gathered together and began heading down to the underground station, as per usual. David, the cult's leader, led a line down the stairs. Behind him followed Linda, another devote follower, and behind her was a fellow named Jack. While everyone was quite orderly and professional when it came to their meetings, Jack's demeanor often remained jovial. As they headed down the stairs, Jack clumsily banged his head on an overhead pipe!\n\n\"Yeowch! Damn!\" shouted Jack, clutching his skull. \n\nThe other cult members paused for a moment to make sure Jack was alright.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm cool,\" Jacked groaned. \"Just... just really got to take it easy from here... my head's pounding now!\"\n\nSo, everyone kept moving. Downward and downward, until they finally reached the ceremony room. There, everybody sat at their assigned seat around the table. David formally squatted into his seat and dusted off his lap. Linda gracefully sat on her chair and adjusted her hood. Jack staggered towards his chair, tripping almost twice. Finally, he managed to lay sideways on his chair, and then slowly sit up straight, still clutching his pulsing cranium.\n\nDavid decided it was time to commence the discussion. He stood and bowed, and then began. \n\n\"This Wednesday, I was chatting with an old war vet at a park.\" David started. \"This man was articulate and full of passion. His stories were long and remarkable. I'd say he talked my ear off. So much so, in fact, that I cut off his ear and took it home. Then, after boiling it, I had it with a fresh apricot. It may seem odd, but I've never really had an apricot, so I decided that the Ritual Meal would be a great time to experience it. So, in the end, I had an old vet's ear with an apricot. Thank you.\" David bowed again and sat down. There was a round of golf claps and murmurs of agreement.\n\nNext, Linda stood, bowed, and cleared her throat. \"My Ritual Meal this week was one of the most exciting ones I've had in a while. I woke up and had some coffee, and then went to sit on my porch. As I sat outside, enjoying my brew, the neighbor began her morning jog. I could see the meat in her young calves. Juicy!\" she shouted. \"So, after her jog, I invited her to my place, where I let her sweat really gloss over her skin. Then, I took the calf in her left leg. I grilled it up and laid out a cooked eel I bought from the Asian food market. I've never had eel before, especially next to grilled calf, so the Ritual Meal was wonderful. Thank you.\" She bowed and sat down. Again, another round of quiet golf claps.\n\nFinally, it was damaged Jack's turn. After a moment of sharp inhales, he slowly, slowly stood. Without bowing he stuttered, \n\"Sorry, guys, I, uh... I definitely ate my Ritual Meal on Tuesday... but after hitting my dang head... yikes, I can barely remember... uh... it hurts to even try to think back...\"\n\n\"It's alright, Jack,\" David said, \"just take your time. We do have all day. Maybe we can help you remember.\"\n\n\"Just try to recollect some of the tiny details.\" suggested Linda.\n\n\"Alright...\" sighed Jack. \"Well, it was... a female. Young... ish. I think she came to my house for some reason... oh! Girl scout! She was a girl scout! And her name... her name was... Dusty? Dezzi? Uh... hm... ah! Desti! It was one of those new generational names, or something. It was Desti!\"\n\n\"Ah, okay, so you had some of Desti, then?\" asked Linda.\n\n\"Right. In fact, when she came into my house, she hit her leg on my table, and I looked down, and just saw this... glistening... bumpy... thing... in the middle of her leg. I can't remember the word for it. It just looked great, so I... that's what I did. I cut it off and used it for my Ritual Meal.\"\n\n\"Sounds good so far...\" said David.\n\n\"Then,\" continued Jack, \"I remember preparing something small. Something small I've never had... it matched the Desti thing I ate in size... it was... a raisin! No, not that... a prune? No, no... damn! I really can't remember! I'm sorry, guys, I've tried as hard as I could. I promise I had a Ritual Meal, and I remember it was... at least, kind of good. Thanks.\" \n\nJack performed a flimsy and quick bow, and then plopped back into his seat. There was a smaller, more confused round of golf claps and murmurs, and then a bit of silence. Just before the crowd was about to decide to let the next person go, David jumped up with a shout of exclamation.\n\n\"Ah ha! I believe I figured out what you've had for your Ritual Meal, Jack!\" he shouted.\n\n\"Really? Do tell!\" pleaded Jack.\n\n\"Well, with all of those details, however fuzzy it may be,\" exclaimed David, \"it sounds a look like you a date with Desti's knee!\"\n\n\n(I made this joke up while bored at work about a month ago.
